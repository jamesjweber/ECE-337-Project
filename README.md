# ECE-337-Project
This project will contain all the Verilog files for our ECE 337 project, which is an ASIC Serpent encoder/decoder.

WARNING: On the first mapped run, it will show a warning about source objects need to contain at least one element. This is a false error. Run mapped again and it will map correctly and without errors.
